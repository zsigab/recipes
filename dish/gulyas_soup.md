# Gulyasleves
## Ingredients
* 600g beef leg (or pork is more traditional)
* 300g onion (white), can be less
* 2 big carrots
* 1 large parsley root (we always skip this)
* 1 little celery root (also skippable)
* 400g potatoes (peeled and diced)
* 1 tbsp sweet paprika (the one in fridge)
* 1/2 tbsp spicy paprika (sub with the sweet one)
* 1 tbsp salt
* 1 tsp ground caraway seed (aka. "fuszerkomeny", but not cumin)
* 2 pcs bayleaf
* ground black pepper
* 1 small tomato
* 1 small (bell)pepper
* 3 cloves garlic
* 2 tbsp lard (sub with oil)
* 2.5l water
* extra: Gulyas cream in a tube, to taste

## Noodle (Csipetke) Ingredients 
* 1 egg
* 80g flour
* 1 tsp salt

## Steps
### Stew preparation
* start with cooking the onion on the lard (or oil), until translucent
* lower heat to minimum or remove pot from heat
* add caraway seed, paprika, let it reheat, careful not to burn
* add ~150ml water, reduce until water is evaporated
* repeat previous water/reduction step (up to 5x, each reduction makes it better)
* add meat, stir and cook until greyed/whitened
* add salt, pepper, garlic, tomato, bell pepper, bay leaf
* add water (enough to cover meat, to look like stew, not a soup yet), cook for 90-120min until meat is softened, cover with lid
* Now have a beef/pork stew, which is sold in some places as goulash :)

### Prepare noodles
* mix all until dough forms, rest it wrapped in fridge for 20 min - 1h
* make small pinches, store with flour so doesnâ€™t stick until placed in soup

### Making it into soup
* add veggies (carrot, potato, parsley, celery root) and 2-2.5l water
* cook for 25-50 more minutes (30 should be enough), until veggies softened
* add noodles, cook 10 more minutes
